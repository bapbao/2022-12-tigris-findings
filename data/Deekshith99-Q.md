## Non Critical

### [N-1] NatSpec is missing 
in some contracts NatSpec comments are missing (mainly on Trading.sol) and other contracts as well

### [N-2] uint and uint256 are same but use any one
its highly recommend to use anyone same through out the code base for better readblity of the code 

###  [N-3] Solidity pragma versioning should be upgraded to latest available version
Currently the solidity version in contracts is ^0.8.0 which was found to possess some bugs later
