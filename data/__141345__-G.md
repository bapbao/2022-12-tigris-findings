#### Variable re-arrangement by storage packing

Reference: [Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

1. 
In `struct Bond`, `bool expired` can be placed before `address owner`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
File: BondNFT.sol
12:     struct Bond {
13:         uint id;
14:         address owner;
15:         address asset;
16:         uint amount;
17:         uint mintEpoch;
18:         uint mintTime;
19:         uint expireEpoch;
20:         uint pending;
21:         uint shares;
22:         uint period;
23:         bool expired;
24:     }
```


2. 
In TradingExtension.sol, `bool public paused` and `bool public chainlinkEnabled` can be placed before `address public trading`, as a result, 2 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

```solidity
File: TradingExtension.sol
13:     address public trading;
14:     uint256 public validSignatureTimer;
15:     bool public chainlinkEnabled;
16:

20:     bool public paused;
```

3.

19: }
```

4.

11:         bool direction;
12:         uint price;
13:         uint tpPrice;
14:         uint slPrice;
15:         uint orderType;
16:         address trader;
17:         uint id;
18:         address tigAsset;
19:         int accInterest;
20:     }
```

5. 
In `struct MintTrade`, `bool direction` can be placed before `address account`, as a result, 1 slot storage can be saved. According to the currently layout, they both occupy 1 slot, but after re-arrangement, they can be packed into 1 slot.

24:         uint256 margin;
25:         uint256 leverage;
26:         uint256 asset;
27:         bool direction;

```

6.

15:         bool direction;
16:         uint256 tpPrice;
17:         uint256 slPrice;

26:         bytes32 s;
27:         bool usePermit;
28:     }
```


#### Multiple address/ID mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address/ID to a struct, where appropriate

Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

Instances number of this issue: 5

1. `asset`
```solidity 
File: BondNFT.sol
32:     mapping(address => bool) public allowedAsset;
33:     mapping(address => uint) private assetsIndex;
```

2. `id`
```solidity 
File: BondNFT.sol
34:     mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private bondPaid;

36:     mapping(uint => Bond) private _idToBond;
```

3. `tigAsset`
```solidity
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
35:     mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) private accRewardsPerShare; // tigAsset => epoch => accRewardsPerShare

37:     mapping(address => uint) public totalShares;
```

4. `asset`

#### Splitting `require()` statements that use &&

`require()` statements with multiple conditions can be split.

See this [issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper.

The demo of the gas comparison can be seen [here](https://github.com/141345/gas_demo/blob/main/multirequire.sol).

Instances number of this issue: 2
```solidity 
File: contracts/PairsContract.sol
52:         require(_maxLeverage >= _minLeverage && _minLeverage > 0, "Wrong leverage values");
53: 

File: contracts/utils/TradingLibrary.sol
116:                 require(
117:                     _priceData.price < assetChainlinkPrice+assetChainlinkPrice*2/100 &&
118:                     _priceData.price > assetChainlinkPrice-assetChainlinkPrice*2/100, "!chainlinkPrice"
119:                 );
``` 

#### `assetsLength()` should not be called multiple times

Each time `assetsLength()` is called, the cost involves a function call and sload. Each storage read uses opcode `sload` which costs 100 gas (warm access), while memory read uses `mload` which only cost 3 gas. 

Instances number of this issue: 4
```solidity
File: contracts/GovNFT.sol
53:         for (uint i=0; i<assetsLength(); i++) {
54:             userPaid[to][assets[i]] += accRewardsPerNFT[assets[i]];

67:         for (uint i=0; i<assetsLength(); i++) {
68:             userPaid[to][assets[i]] += accRewardsPerNFT[assets[i]];
69:         }

78:         for (uint i=0; i<assetsLength(); i++) {

82:         }

095:        for (uint i=0; i<assetsLength(); i++) {
    
100:        }
```

Suggestion:
Save the result of `assetsLength()` into local cache.


#### `epoch[_tigAsset]` update can be moved out of loop

Each storage writes uses opcode `sstore` which costs 100 gas (warm access), while memory write uses `mstore` which only cost 3 gas. 
```solidity
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
220:                 for (uint i=epoch[_tigAsset]; i<aEpoch; i++) {
221:                     epoch[_tigAsset] += 1;
222:                     accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i+1] = accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i];
223:                 }
```

Suggestion:
Move `epoch[_tigAsset]` update outside loop. Since the final value is known to be `aEpoch`.


#### `bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]` can be removed

Plus and minus `bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]` can cancel each other, so can be removed.
Each storage read uses opcode `sload` which costs 100 gas (warm access). Total 200 gas. 

```solidity
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
178:                 uint _pendingDelta = (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]) - (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][bond.expireEpoch-1] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]);
```

#### `balanceOf(owner)` can be saved to local cache

Each time `balanceOf(owner)` is called, the storage read uses opcode `sload` which costs 100 gas (warm access), while memory read uses `mload` which only cost 3 gas. 

Instances number of this issue: 4
```solidity
File: contracts/GovNFT.sol
80:             userDebt[owner][assets[i]] -= userPaid[owner][assets[i]]/balanceOf(owner);
81:             userPaid[owner][assets[i]] -= userPaid[owner][assets[i]]/balanceOf(owner);            

97:             userDebt[from][assets[i]] -= userPaid[from][assets[i]]/balanceOf(from);
98:             userPaid[from][assets[i]] -= userPaid[from][assets[i]]/balanceOf(from);
```

Suggestion:
Save the result of `balanceOf(owner)` into local cache.


#### `epoch[bond.asset]` can be saved into local cache

Each time `epoch[bond.asset]` is referred the storage read uses opcode `sload` which costs 100 gas (warm access), while memory read uses `mload` which only cost 3 gas. 

```solidity
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
110:         require(epoch[bond.asset] == block.timestamp/DAY, "Bad epoch");

121:             _bond.mintEpoch = epoch[bond.asset];
122:             bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] * _bond.shares / 1e18;
```

Suggestion:
Save the result of `epoch[bond.asset]` into local cache.


#### `idToBond(_id)` reference 

There are multiple call to `idToBond(_id)`. Some of the reference can just copy the required variables by demand instead of the whole struct.
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declaring the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incurring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct.

Instances number of this issue: 4
```solidity 
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
104:         Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);

141:         Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);

172:         Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);

328:         Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);
```


#### can only read `_trade.asset` 

The only needed variable is `_trade.asset`, so no need to copy the whole struct.
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declaring the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incurring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read.

237:         IPosition.Trade memory _trade = position.trades(_id);
```

#### `longOi[_asset][_tigAsset]` and `shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]` can be saved to local cache

When refer to `longOi[_asset][_tigAsset]` and `shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]`, the opcode `sload` which costs 100 gas (warm access), while memory read uses `mload` which only cost 3 gas. 

```solidity
File: contracts/Position.sol
099:     function updateFunding(uint256 _asset, address _tigAsset, uint256 _longOi, uint256 _shortOi, uint256 _baseFundingRate, uint _vaultFundingPercent) external onlyMinter {
100:         if(longOi[_asset][_tigAsset] < shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]) {
101:             if (longOi[_asset][_tigAsset] > 0) {
102:                 accInterestPerOi[_asset][_tigAsset][true] += ((int256(block.timestamp-lastUpdate[_asset][_tigAsset])*fundingDeltaPerSec[_asset][_tigAsset])*1e18/int256(longOi[_asset][_tigAsset]))*int256(1e10-vaultFundingPercent[_asset][_tigAsset])/1e10;
103:             }
104:             accInterestPerOi[_asset][_tigAsset][false] -= (int256(block.timestamp-lastUpdate[_asset][_tigAsset])*fundingDeltaPerSec[_asset][_tigAsset])*1e18/int256(shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]);
105: 
106:         } else if(longOi[_asset][_tigAsset] > shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]) {
107:             accInterestPerOi[_asset][_tigAsset][true] -= (int256(block.timestamp-lastUpdate[_asset][_tigAsset])*fundingDeltaPerSec[_asset][_tigAsset])*1e18/int256(longOi[_asset][_tigAsset]);
108:             if (shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset] > 0) {
109:                 accInterestPerOi[_asset][_tigAsset][false] += ((int256(block.timestamp-lastUpdate[_asset][_tigAsset])*fundingDeltaPerSec[_asset][_tigAsset])*1e18/int256(shortOi[_asset][_tigAsset]))*int256(1e10-vaultFundingPercent[_asset][_tigAsset])/1e10;
110:             }
111:         }

```


#### `setAccInterest(_id)` can be moved into the if block

Since the accInterest will only make sense if the position still exists. 1 sstore of 100 gas could be saved.

```solidity
File: contracts/Trading.sol
613:         position.setAccInterest(_id);
614:         _updateFunding(_trade.asset, _trade.tigAsset);
615:         if (_percent < DIVISION_CONSTANT) {
616:             if ((_trade.margin*_trade.leverage*(DIVISION_CONSTANT-_percent)/DIVISION_CONSTANT)/1e18 < tradingExtension.minPos(_trade.tigAsset)) revert("!size");
617:             position.reducePosition(_id, _percent);
618:         } else {
619:             position.burn(_id);
620:         }
```
