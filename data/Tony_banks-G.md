Use memory variables for temporary storage instead of storage variables, as memory variables are cheaper to access.
Avoid using dynamic arrays in mappings, as they can be more expensive to access.
Use the view and pure keywords for functions that do not modify the state of the contract, as they are cheaper to execute than functions that modify the state.
Consider using the bytes type instead of string for storing long strings, as it is more efficient in terms of gas usage.
Use the min and max functions in the updateAssetLeverage function to ensure that the minimum and maximum leverage values are always set correctly, rather than using multiple if statements.
Use the isContract function to check if an address is a contract address before calling functions on it, as this can be cheaper than calling a function on a contract that does not exist.
Consider using the uint type instead of uint256 for storing values, as it can be more efficient in terms of gas usage.
