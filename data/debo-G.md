For loop over dynamic array: 
Loops that do not have a fixed number of iterations, for example, loops that depend on storage values, have to be used carefully. 
Due to the block gas limit, transactions can only consume a certain amount of gas. 
The number of iterations in a loop can grow beyond the block gas limit which can cause the complete contract to be stalled at a certain point. 
Additionally, using unbounded loops incurs in a lot of avoidable gas costs. 
Carefully test how many items at maximum you can pass to such functions to make it successful.
